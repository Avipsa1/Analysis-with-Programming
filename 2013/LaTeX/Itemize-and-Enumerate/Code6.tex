  \item[Normal] In probability theory, the normal (or Gaussian)
distribution is a very commonly occurring continuous probability
distributionâ€”a function that tells the probability of a number
in some context falling between any two real numbers.
  \item[Uniform] In probability theory and statistics, the continuous
uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of
symmetric probability distributions such that for each member of
the family, all intervals of the same length on the distribution's
support are equally probable.
  \item[Exponential] In probability theory and statistics, the
exponential distribution (a.k.a. negative exponential distribution)
is the probability distribution that describes the time between
events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur
continuously and independently at a constant average rate.
